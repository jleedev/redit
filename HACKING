We are a couple of Vim hackers who have never quite managed to acclimate
ourselves to Emacs, and who, like most, have developed a distaste for
Vim script.

Our general strategy here is going to be to start mostly from scratch,
with an awareness of how we want our editor to behave but mostly
disregarding the implementation details of Vim, Emacs, or anything else
currently used to edit text.

One strategy for building a text editor is to recapitulate the evolution
of text editors in miniature---that is, build from a line editor to a
visual editor to a GUI editor to a semantic object-aware editor. This
gets enterprisey very quickly.

We are going to take a slightly different tack: roughly, we will grow in
two dimensions, progressing in the direction of usability and visual
fluency on the one hand and in the direction of object-awareness on the
other. The resulting program should then be beautiful, usable, and
powerful, or else incomplete.
