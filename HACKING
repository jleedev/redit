We are a couple of Vim hackers who have never quite managed to acclimate
ourselves to Emacs, and who, like most, have developed a distaste for
Vim script.

Our general strategy here is going to be to start mostly from scratch,
with an awareness of how we want our editor to behave but mostly
disregarding the implementation details of Vim, Emacs, or anything else
currently used to edit text.

It seems reasonable to recapitulate the development of the text editor
in general in our own development process; thus, we expect to progress
from a line editor to a visual-mode editor to a GUI editor, using our
work at each stage to bootstrap the next.

Our design is probably going to consist of looping on input, and then
executing commands. We're going to build extensibility into this,
allowing plugins and what-have-you to specify their own commands and
possibly strap themselves to existing commands. It's going to be pretty
sweet.
